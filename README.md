# blog-engine
A blog program written in PHP with MySQL as the DB backend.

This blog engine written in PHP was adapted from the old book 'Blog Design Solutions' 
by Richard Rutter (https://www.amazon.com/Blog-Design-Solutions-Richard-Rutter/dp/1590595815).
It was originally written in the old version PHP4 connecting to MySQL 4.1; but I made it to work in PHP8 connecting to MySQL8.
I did significant changes to the code-base by refactoring and restructuring it to a more modular form. I also converted some
abstractions into an object-oriented form as an exercise for applying what I learned in my self-study of OOP.
